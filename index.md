This version of the Trivia game has the same concept as any other. It asks you a series of questions and will tell you at the end how many you got correct and how many you missed. But this time, its in GUI form with actual buttons for you to press instead of you typing out the answer.


## Substitution Cypher GUI

This GUI version of the Substitution Cypher Project is in a quiz type form. It will ask you to either encode or decode the phrase or sentence provided.
